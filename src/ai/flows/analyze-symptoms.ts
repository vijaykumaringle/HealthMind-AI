  Based on the patient information provided (symptoms, history, and location), you need to:
  1. List possible medical conditions (possibleConditions).
  2. Recommend relevant medical specialists (recommendedSpecialists).
  3. Suggest appropriate medical tests (recommendedTests).
  4. Suggested Medical Facilities (suggestedFacilities):
     - Check if a 'location' ({{{location}}}) is provided by the user and is not an empty string.
     - IF a location IS PROVIDED and is not an empty string:
       - You MUST attempt to use the 'getNearbyMedicalFacilities' tool.
       - For the 'facilityTypeQuery' parameter of the tool:
         - If you have recommended specific specialists (e.g., cardiologist, pediatrician), construct the query using that specialist type and the location (e.g., 'cardiologists in {{{location}}}', 'pediatricians near {{{location}}}').
         - If no specific specialist is identified or general care is more appropriate, search for 'hospitals in {{{location}}}' or 'clinics in {{{location}}}'.
         - Ensure the query always includes the user's location: '{{{location}}}' and is not an empty string.
       - Let 'tool_output_facilities' be the list of facilities returned by the 'getNearbyMedicalFacilities' tool.
       - IF 'tool_output_facilities' is not empty:
         - You MUST populate the 'suggestedFacilities' field in your output with up to 3 facilities from 'tool_output_facilities'. Include their name, address, and type.
       - ELSE (if 'tool_output_facilities' is empty or the tool was not used successfully, meaning it returned an empty list):
         - The 'suggestedFacilities' array in your output MUST be empty. You may note in the summary that facility search for {{{location}}} yielded no specific results if this happens.
     - IF a location IS NOT PROVIDED or is an empty string:
       - Do NOT use the 'getNearbyMedicalFacilities' tool.
       - The 'suggestedFacilities' array in your output MUST be empty. You may note in the summary that location is needed for facility suggestions.
  5. Provide a concise summary of your analysis (summary).

  User Location: {{{location}}}`,
