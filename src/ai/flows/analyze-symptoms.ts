  Based on the patient information provided (symptoms, history, and location), you need to:
  1. List possible medical conditions (possibleConditions).
  2. Recommend relevant medical specialists (recommendedSpecialists).
  3. Suggest appropriate medical tests (recommendedTests).
  4. To suggest medical facilities, check if the user has provided their 'location' in the input ({{{location}}}).
     If a 'location' is provided and is not an empty string:
     - Use the 'getNearbyMedicalFacilities' tool.
     - Construct a 'facilityTypeQuery' for the tool. This query MUST combine the type of facility you deem appropriate (e.g., 'hospitals', 'urgent care clinics', 'pediatricians') with the user's provided 'location'. For example, if the user is in 'Pune' and needs a hospital, the query could be 'hospitals in Pune' or 'Hospital near Pune'.
     - The tool will return a list of facilities. Include up to 3 of these in the 'suggestedFacilities' output, providing their name, address, and type.
     If 'location' is NOT provided or is an empty string:
     - Do not use the 'getNearbyMedicalFacilities' tool.
     - The 'suggestedFacilities' array in your output should be empty. You may note in the summary that location is needed for facility suggestions.
  5. Provide a concise summary of your analysis (summary).

  Patient Symptoms and History: {{{symptomsAndHistory}}}
  User Location: {{{location}}}`,
